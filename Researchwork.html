			<h4><a href="#">A Survey of Applications of MFC and Recent Progress of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Techniques<br />
				</a></h2>
		</header>
		<p>Artificial Intelligence help reduce computation and model costs. It saves time and is more efficient than previously used manual methods, which are now obsolete. In order to find the most accurate results, the study would compare all currently available research efforts and focus on implementing Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning concepts within the Microbial Fuel Cell and comparison with other fuel cells.</p>

			<h4><a href="#">IoT-Based Smart Parking System<br />
				</a></h2>
		</header>
		<p> In this project, we plan to introduce an altered plan of an Internet of Things (IoT) empowered smart parking system to tackle the parking issue in the city. The system includes an on-location organization of the various sensors, which are utilized to recognize the accessibility of the parking spaces and send data to the server about the equivalent. A real-time web link will be given that permits an end client to take a look at the accessibility of a parking space and book it for a given time frame.</p>
